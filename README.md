## Requirements and Installation
* A computer running macOS or Linux
* For training new models, you'll also need a NVIDIA GPU and [NCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl)
* Python version 3.6
* A [PyTorch installation](http://pytorch.org/)

## FILE description

* ./mixup_img stored example generated mixup_v2 image
    b         stored the image generated by Beta distribution, x1, x2 are original image, mixup is generated image
    guassian  stored the image generated by Gaussian distribution, x1, x2 are original image, mixup is generated image

* ./img_show  stored mixup image code

* ./checkpoint  : Stored with trained models
    ResNet18 : Stored baseline best model of ResNet18 
    ResNet18_v2 : Stored the best model of ResNet18 using the modified mixup, including the results obtained by training 200 epochs by default and training 1000 epochs respectively
    DenseNet190 : Stored baseline best model of DenseNet190 
    DenseNet190_v2 : Stored the best model of DenseNet190 using the modified mixup

* ./results   : Stored training log
    ResNet18_baseline  
    ResNet18_v2_epoch200
    ResNet18_v2_epoch1000
    DenseNet190
    DenseNet190_v2_epoch200

* ./mixup.py  :   original mixup function
* ./mixup_v2.py : modified mixup function
* ./mixup_v3.py : modified criterion function, need to change line#25 in train.py when using

* ./train.py  
    (Modify line 25 during training. If you use the original mixup, change it to import mixup as mp
            Use the modified mixup to import mixup_v2 as mp)
    

## Training
Use `python train.py` to train a new model.
Here is an example setting:
```
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --lr=0.1 --seed=20170922 --decay=1e-4
```
